Hello there.

Uhh idk what to put here. I'm on GitHub so it's probably a given that I can code.

Gaze upon some of my projects if you want.

Spoiler: They're quite bad so don't expect much c:

Also I haven't put everything up here. I still have a whole bunch of project folders just sitting there. I'll upload them to github when I can be bothered.

Have a nice day!
